# Overview

This repo serves two purposes: 
 1) Host a page of resources for friends, family, etc. looking to [learn more about covid-19 and what the next 6-12 months might look like](https://mackaytc.github.io/covid-resources/)
 2) Provide a place to store useful data, code, and papers for covid-related research, etc.

# Guide to Covid-19 Resources

The goal of this file is to keep track of useful covid-related data, studies, etc.

## Where Should I Start? 

I've included a "highlight reel" of the resources I've found most useful for trying to understand the covid-19 pandemic. Definitely start by checking out the following:
 * ___If you want a single source to go to for daily news and updates on covid,  [the Covid Daily News podcast is your best option](https://omny.fm/shows/the-coronavirus-daily-podcast-the-most-important-n)___
    *  This podcast provides an analytical perspective on covid news, and emphasizes comparisons in outcomes and policy responses _across_ countries, which can be helpful when US media coverage frequently isn't very detailed or informative!
    * If you're just getting started listening, scroll back in the feed and pick up on topics that are of interest (more recent episodes assume an increasing level of familiarity with the subject matter).
    * Full disclosure, neither host is a public health expert but that's not really the "niche" they're trying to fill. Instead, they aggregate news from a range of well-vetted sources and give you key takeaways.
 * If you're looking for up-to-date information on the number of cases / fatalities / etc. in the US as a whole and for individual states, ___[this NYT page provides a ton of regularly-updated graphs and statistics](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html)___
    * The graphs by state organized by states where cases are increasing / decreasing over time are particularly useful
 * ___If you're looking for projections and trying see what experts think the next few months will look like, [538 is tracking the projections from several of the most widely-cited forecasts of the covid pandemic](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/covid-forecasts)___

## What if I'm on Twitter?

Here's a (very abbreviated) list of epidemiology and public health folks I've found especially helpful to follow:
 * [Trevor Bedford](https://twitter.com/trvrb) is an epidemiologist at the Fred Hutchins Cancer Research Center
 * [Carl Bergstrom](https://twitter.com/CT_Bergstrom) is a professor of biology at University of Washington
 * [Natalie Dean](https://twitter.com/nataliexdean) is a professor of biostats at University of Florida
 
[Ed Yong](https://twitter.com/edyong209) is science writer at the Atlantic who put togther [a thread of longer-form news articles on covid](https://twitter.com/edyong209/status/1256303440243933184?s=21) that is worth reading through as well.

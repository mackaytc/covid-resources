# Guide to Covid-19 Resources

The goal of this file is to keep track of useful covid-related data, studies, etc. The page here offers an overview of basic resources related to covid. If you scroll up, you'll also find subfolders with data, code, links to models, etc. 

## Where Should I Start? 

I've included a "highlight reel" of the resources I've found most useful for trying to understand the covid-19 pandemic. Definitely start by checking out the following:
 * ___If you want a single source to go to for daily news and updates on covid,  [the Covid Daily News podcast is your best option](https://omny.fm/shows/the-coronavirus-daily-podcast-the-most-important-n)___
    *  This podcast provides an analytical perspective on covid news, and emphasizes comparisons in outcomes and policy responses across countries. If you're just getting started listening, scroll back in the feed and pick up on topics that are of interest (more recent episodes assume an increasing level of familiarity with the subject matter).
    * Full disclosure, neither host is a public health expert but that's not really the "niche" they're trying to fill. Instead, they aggregate news from a range of well-vetted sources and give you key takeaways.
 * If you're looking for up-to-date information on the number of cases / fatalities / etc. in the US as a whole and for individual states, ___[this NYT page provides a ton of regularly-updated graphs and statistics](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html)___
    * The graphs by state organized by states where cases are increasing / decreasing over time are particularly helpful
 * ___If you're looking for projections and trying see what experts think the next few months will look like, [538 is tracking the projections from several of the most widely-cited forecasts of the covid pandemic](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/covid-forecasts)___

## What's on Twitter?

Here's a (very abbreviated) list of epidemiology and public health folks I've found especially helpful to follow:
 * [Trevor Bedford](https://twitter.com/trvrb) is an epidemiologist at the Fred Hutchins Cancer Research Center
 * [Carl Bergstrom](https://twitter.com/CT_Bergstrom) is a professor of biology at University of Washington
 * [Natalie Dean](https://twitter.com/nataliexdean) is a professor of biostats at University of Florida
 
[Ed Yong](https://twitter.com/edyong209) is science writer at the Atlantic who put togther [a thread of longer-form news articles on covid](https://twitter.com/edyong209/status/1256303440243933184?s=21) that is worth reading through as well.

## Thinking about the Future

_How many new cases will there be? How many tests will we be performing?_ We'd all love to know the answers to these questions. Coming up with good predictions, however, is incredibly difficult and our best guess answers to them can change dramatically as we get new information. Why is there so much uncertainty?

Forecasting something like a pandemic is incredibly challenging. Gathering data is difficult, the statistics can be complicated, and as [Zeynep Tufekci writes for The Atlantic:](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/04/coronavirus-models-arent-supposed-be-right/609271/)

> When an epidemiological model is believed and acted on, it can look like it was false. These models are not snapshots of the future. They always describe a range of possibilities â€” and those possibilities are highly sensitive to our actions. 

What's the point of trying to forecast things when there's so much uncertainty?

> The most important function of epidemiological models is as a simulation, a way to see our potential futures ahead of time, and how that interacts with the choices we make today. 

If you want a detailed discussion of the many challenges involved in forecasting this pandemic, [538 has a detailed discussion (with lots of cool visuals)](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-its-so-freaking-hard-to-make-a-good-covid-19-model/). 

## What Else is Here? 

Folders included in this repo: 
 * [`widely-cited-studies-and-models`](https://github.com/mackaytc/covid-resources/tree/master/widely-cited-studies-and-models) has PDF copies of some of the most widely cited studies (e.g. the ICL report, etc.) and links to covid-19 forecasts from IHME, UT Austin, MIT, etc.
 * [`data`](https://github.com/mackaytc/covid-resources/tree/master/data) has a range of covid-related data sets, including social distancing policies, ...

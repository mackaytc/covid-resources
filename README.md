# Guide to Covid-19 Resources Online

The goal of this file is to keep track of useful covid-related data, studies, etc.

## Where Should I Start? 

I've included a "highlight reel" of the resources I've found most useful for trying to understand the covid-19 pandemic. Definitely start by checking out the following:
 * If you want a single source to go to for daily news and updates on covid,  [the Covid Daily News podcast is your best option](http://www.google.com)
    *  This podcast provides an analytical + international perspective on covid news, and emphasizes comparisons in outcomes and policy responses _across_ countries. 
    * If you're just getting started listening, scroll back in the feed and pick up on topics that are of interest (more recent episodes assume an increasing level of familiarity with the subject matter).
    * Full disclosure, neither host is a public health expert but that's not really the "niche" they're trying to fill. Instead, they aggregate news from a range of well-vetted sources and give you key takeaways.
 * If you're looking for projections and trying see what experts think the next few months will look like, [538 is tracking the projections from several of the most widely-cited forecasts of the covid pandemic](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/covid-forecasts)

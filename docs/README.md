# Guide to Covid-19 Resources

This page offers a brief overview of resources to help you learn more about covid and what the next 6-12 months look like. You can also visit [GitHub](https://github.com/mackaytc/covid-resources), where I've posted some additional data, code, links to models, etc. 

## Where Should I Start? 

Here's a "highlight reel" of the resources I've found most useful for trying to understand the covid-19 pandemic. Definitely start by checking out the following:
 * ___If you want a single source to go to for daily news and updates on covid,  [the Covid Daily News podcast is your best option](https://omny.fm/shows/the-coronavirus-daily-podcast-the-most-important-n)___
    *  This podcast provides an analytical perspective on covid news, and emphasizes comparisons in outcomes and policy responses across countries. If you're just getting started listening, scroll back in the feed and pick up on topics that are of interest (more recent episodes assume an increasing level of familiarity with the subject matter).
    * Full disclosure, neither host is a public health expert but that's not really the "niche" they're trying to fill. Instead, they aggregate news from a range of well-vetted sources and give you key takeaways.
 * If you're looking for up-to-date information on the number of cases / fatalities / etc. in the US as a whole and for individual states, ___[this NYT page provides a ton of regularly-updated graphs and statistics](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html)___
    * The graphs by state organized by states where cases are increasing / decreasing over time are particularly helpful
 * ___If you're looking for projections and trying see what experts think the next few months will look like, [538 is tracking the projections from several of the most widely-cited forecasts of the covid pandemic](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/covid-forecasts)___

##  Frequently Asked Questions

#### _Why am I still stuck sitting at home all day?_

If you feel uncertainty about what’s been going on and why, you’re not alone!
 * When we first locked down, everyone talked about “flattening the curve” a lot.
 * That meant trying to prevent cases from growing so fast that hospitals were overwhelmed... which was a (very) important goal and first step.
 * But it’s just a first step!

In other countries, governments used the time bought by locking down to massively expand their ability to (1) test for coronavirus and (2) trace the spread of cases throughout local communities and contact folks who might’ve been exposed.
 * Unfortunately, we haven’t done that on a sufficient scale in the US.
 * This means that we’re stuck in a kind of “no man’s land” where we’ve slowed down the spread of the virus (good) but haven’t built up the capacity to start going out more (bad).

####  _Aren’t we doing a lot of testing? How much more do we really need to do?!_

When lockdown first started, public health officials recommended only trying to get tested if you were experiencing symptoms of virus. But that was a _short term_ response to how few tests we had at the time. 
 
 * Ideally, we should have enough tests that everyone in the US can be tested regularly.
 * At a minimum, we should all be able to get a test relatively quickly, regardless of symptoms or health.
 
 Why do tests matter so much? Can’t you test negative one day then get infected the next? 
 * _Widespread testing plays the same role for communities as smoke detectors play in your home._
 * Without a smoke detector, if a fire starts and you’re in another room, sleeping, etc. that fire has time to grow before you to notice it. With a smoke detector, the minute there’s a problem, you’re alerted and you have time to respond.
 * In the same way, without widespread testing, lots of people in a community can get infected before folks start showing up in local hospitals in appreciable amounts and public health officials realize there’s an issue.
 * Testing lets communities contain the spread of coronavirus _before_ outbreaks get so bad that we have to go into lockdown to slow them down.

#### _There’s lots of discussion now about reopening our economy. Don’t we have to start getting back to normal at some point?_

The point of this guide isn’t to get bogged down in broader policy debates, but it’s important to remember that the vast majority of public health officials, economists, and business leaders agree that _developing the tools required to contain the virus is the only way to get back on track economically._
 * You might be willing to go to a restaurant if it reopened, but would you go to a movie theater? A concert? Everyone’s risk tolerance is different, but we’re all going to be a bit less likely to go out while the virus is still spreading.
 * Ignoring the virus isn’t a sustainable option because as long as it’s spreading, demand for everything from air travel and hotels to new cars and everything in between will be depressed.

#### _What activities can I do safely? What activities are riskier?_

Most evidence suggests that the riskiest scenarios are those that place you in sustained, close contact indoors with people outside of your immediate household
* Being outside doesn’t guarantee you can’t get sick (especially when contact with others is sustained) but it’s a lot safer, so don’t feel bad about going to a local park!

#### _Why the heck should I listen to what you’re saying?!_

I definitely don’t claim to be an expert! I’ve tried to include links for resources that discuss everything here in greater detail and you should definitely check those out. My only goal here is to relay information in a way that might be easier to get through than the original sources.

## Plans for Dealing with the Pandemic and Reopening the Economy

There have been several widely-discussed proposals for how we should think about dealing with the covid pandemic and gradually reopening the economy. If you want a quick summary of these proposals, you can read [German Lopez writing for Vox about them here](https://www.vox.com/2020/4/14/21218074/coronavirus-plans-social-distancing-end-reopen-economy). While each specific plan varies a bit, every plan shares common themes including the importance of [_readily-available testing_](https://www.heart.org/en/news/2020/04/02/covid-19-science-why-testing-is-so-important) and [_contact tracing_](https://www.vox.com/2020/5/4/21242825/coronavirus-covid-19-contact-tracing-jobs-apps).

You can read the reports themselves here:
 * A "bipartisan group of experts in economics, public health, technology and ethics" based out of Harvard's Center for Ethics has [put out a plan](https://ethics.harvard.edu/covid-19-response)
 * AEI, a conservative-leaning think tank, [has a plan of their own](https://www.aei.org/research-products/report/national-coronavirus-response-a-road-map-to-reopening/)
 * Center for American Progress, a liberal-leaning think tank, also has [their own plan](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/healthcare/news/2020/04/03/482613/national-state-plan-end-coronavirus-crisis/)
 
There's several useful resources for thinking about what your workplace would need to do to be safer as well (whether it's an office, school, construction site, etc.):
 * [Recommendations by workplace](https://www.backtoworksafely.org) from a group of occupational safety experts
 * [This site is more geared towards local governments](https://covidlocal.org) but provides useful general reopening guidelines and gives you a sense of what we should be looking for from local and state leaders 

## Thinking about the Future

#### _How many new cases will there be? How many tests will we be performing?_ 

We'd all love to know the answers to these questions. Coming up with good predictions, however, is incredibly difficult and our best guess answers to them can change dramatically as we get new information. Why is there so much uncertainty?

Forecasting something like a pandemic is incredibly challenging. Gathering data is difficult, the statistics can be complicated, and as [Zeynep Tufekci writes for The Atlantic:](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/04/coronavirus-models-arent-supposed-be-right/609271/)

> When an epidemiological model is believed and acted on, it can look like it was false. These models are not snapshots of the future. They always describe a range of possibilities — and those possibilities are highly sensitive to our actions. 

What's the point of trying to forecast things when there's so much uncertainty?

> The most important function of epidemiological models is as a simulation, a way to see our potential futures ahead of time, and how that interacts with the choices we make today. 

If you want a detailed discussion of the many challenges involved in forecasting this pandemic, [538 has a detailed discussion (with lots of cool visuals)](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-its-so-freaking-hard-to-make-a-good-covid-19-model/). 

## What's on Twitter?

Here's a (very abbreviated) list of epidemiology and public health folks I've found especially helpful to follow:
 * [Trevor Bedford](https://twitter.com/trvrb) is an epidemiologist at the Fred Hutchins Cancer Research Center
 * [Carl Bergstrom](https://twitter.com/CT_Bergstrom) is a professor of biology at University of Washington
 * [Natalie Dean](https://twitter.com/nataliexdean) is a professor of biostats at University of Florida
 
[Ed Yong](https://twitter.com/edyong209) is a science writer at the Atlantic who put togther [a thread of longer-form news articles on covid](https://twitter.com/edyong209/status/1256303440243933184?s=21) that is worth reading through as well.
